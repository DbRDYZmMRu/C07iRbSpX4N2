                            <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Early Life and Roots</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">Howard Frith Hilton, born on May 23, 1993, to two Yoruba parents in the city of Sango-Ota, was christened Ademola Ogundipe. He grew up surrounded by the quiet echoes of a now-dwindling atmosphere, the rustic air of solitude he often mentions missing in his writings. He still resides in his parents' home.</p>
                            <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Academic and Professional Foundations</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">Frith graduated from Crawford University, Igbesa, with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, which laid the foundation for his brief tenure as a web developer for various enterprises. This experience became the bedrock of his career.</p>
                            <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Breakthrough in Music</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">When asked about his first significant recognition, Frith responds simply, “Moonlight. It was XXXtentacion’s moon.” He then adds with a broad smile, “That shined a light on me; I was on the map.”</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                                This moment came in 2018, a few weeks after the original record’s release. Frith, then a web developer for a local startup, was preparing to start a band with an associate. They had begun planning a debut tape, but his partner’s absence from XXXtentacion’s “Moonlight” cover led to the project becoming a solo effort, building from his recent success. Thus, H.I.V. (Heartbreak In View) was born. Released in 2019 on SoundCloud under the moniker “TheoPhil,” with a bio that read, “Phil 4 U,” Frith’s debut music tape garnered attention. He promised fans a new body of work titled Sad Boi Tap3, but it was never released.</p>
                            <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Evolution as a Poet</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">In 2019, after enjoying quiet success with significant plays on SoundCloud, Frith left his day job to focus on his art. He continued to release songs, including “Sunday Special” from H.I.V., but little was publicized after the music video for “Bleeding Heart.” His presence dimmed as he quietly withdrew from social media. Known for his activity on Facebook, he shifted to Twitter (now X), where he had few followers. At the time, he declared himself Kelsey Karter’s biggest fan, reading all comments without contributing much himself. When questioned, he explained, “I was curious about astrology. I didn’t understand how it’s a science.”</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                                It was not until 2020, after rediscovering Jessica Andrea, his favorite rapper’s ex-wife, that his poetic fervor became evident. Her presence in his social sphere gave him a voice, particularly within the warm community of the rapper’s fans, RATTPACK. His comments began to pour in, followed by emails. “I sent her the first email on September 14, 2020; the timestamp reads 11:57 PM, and I simply said, ‘Hi, I hope you get this. I really need to know if you get this.’” He wrote poetry for her frequently on X, introducing himself with five haiku poems before sharing other prosodic rants and poetic posts. A search for “itsjessandrea” at the time yielded more results from his tweets—mostly poems—than from any other account. Andrea had just returned to making music following her divorce, and Frith’s role was that of a muse, portraying a new, estranged love. Though playing a student might have been more fitting, he dedicated his second poetry collection to Taylor Swift, acknowledging her as his teacher in a poem titled “Teacher.”</p>
                            <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Literary Achievements and Notable Connections</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">The two continued their connection and spent their first Christmas holiday together. Through Jessica, Frith met Melanie Joy Fontana, whose praise for his poetry meant the world to him. Melanie, a renowned songwriter with credits for artists like Dua Lipa, Britney Spears, and BTS, left a significant impact.</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                                Frith soon self-published his first poetry book, Forest Collection I, under the pen name Forest Theo Nightswan, with a dedication to Betty, a character from Taylor Swift’s Folklore album. The poetry book, heavily influenced by Swift’s work, used her themes and song titles to craft a narrative about his love for her amidst his own turbulent family dynamics.</p>
                            <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                                In private circles, Frith’s reputation as a burgeoning poet gained momentum with the book’s release. Its first edition caught the attention of the Kardashian family, with Kendall expressing admiration for the poet and Kylie showing early appreciation for his poetic mood. Frith has since dedicated several poetry books to both Jenners.</p>
