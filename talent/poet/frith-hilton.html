        "description": "Frith Hilton is a poet and musical artist, known for his poetry collections and music tapes like H.I.V., signed under Frith Nightswan Enterprises. This article explores his early life, academic background, breakthrough in music, evolution as a poet, literary achievements, and continued growth.",
        "articleBody": "Howard Frith Hilton, a Sagittarius of the 17th, grew up surrounded by the quiet echoes of a now-dwindling atmosphere, the rustic air of solitude he often mentions missing in his writings. Reimagining his life's journey, inspired by the Hiltons, he formally legalized his full name, Howard Frith Hilton, to be represented by the initials H.F.H. Frith holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which laid the foundation for his brief tenure as a web developer for various enterprises, ultimately becoming the bedrock of his career. When asked about his first significant recognition, Frith responded simply, “Moonlight. It was XXXtentacion’s moon.” He then added with a broad smile, “That shined a light on me; I was on the map.” This moment came in 2018, a few weeks after the original record’s release. Frith, then a web developer for a local startup, was preparing to start a band with an associate. They had begun planning a debut tape, but his partner’s absence from XXXtentacion’s Moonlight cover led to the project becoming a solo effort. Building from his recent success, the H.I.V. (Heartbreak In View) music tape was born. Released in September 2019 on SoundCloud under the moniker “TheoPhil,” with a bio that read, “Phil 4 U,” Frith’s debut music tape garnered attention. He promised fans a new body of work titled Sad Boi Tap3, but it was never released. In 2019, after enjoying quiet success with significant plays on SoundCloud, Frith Hilton left his day job to focus on his art, and he continued to release songs, including Sunday Special from H.I.V, but little was publicized after the music video for Bleeding Heart. His presence dimmed as he quietly withdrew from his page. Known for his activity on Facebook, he shifted to Twitter (now X), where he had fewer followers. At the time, he declared himself Kelsey Karter’s biggest fan — whom he'd met after her infamous Harry Styles face tattoo clickbait record — reading all comments to her posts without contributing much himself. When questioned, he explained, “I was curious about astrology. I didn’t understand how it’s a science.” It was not until 2020, after rediscovering Jessica Andrea, his favorite rapper’s ex-wife, that his poetic fervor became evident. Her presence in his social sphere gave him a voice, particularly within the warm community of the rapper’s fans, RATTPACK. His comments began to pour in, followed by emails. “I sent her the first email on September 14, 2020; the timestamp reads 11:57 PM, and I simply said, ‘Hi, I hope you get this. I really need to know if you get this.’” He wrote poetry for her frequently on X, introducing himself with five haiku poems before sharing other prosodic rants and poetic posts. A search for “itsjessandrea” at the time yielded more results from his tweets — mostly poems — than from any other account. Jessica Andrea had just returned to making music following her divorce, and Frith Hilton’s role was that of a muse, portraying a new cyber boyfriend. Though playing a student might have been more fitting. He dedicated his second poetry collection to Taylor Swift, acknowledging her as his teacher in a poem titled “Teacher.” The two continued their connection and spent their first Christmas holiday together. Through Jessica, Frith met Melanie Joy Fontana, whose praise for his poetry meant the world to him. Melanie, a renowned songwriter with credits for artists like Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, Britney Spears, and BTS, left a significant impact. Frith Hilton soon self-published his first poetry book, Forest Collection, under the pen name Forest Theo Nightswan, dedicating it to Betty, a character from Taylor Swift’s Folklore album. The poetry book, heavily influenced by Taylor Swift’s studio albums, used her themes and song titles up until the Evermore album to craft a narrative about his love for her, amidst his own turbulent grip on direction for his future as a poet and musical artist. In private circles, Frith Hilton’s reputation as a burgeoning poet gained momentum with the release of his debut poetry book. Its first edition caught the attention of the Kardashian family, with Kendall Jenner expressing admiration for the poet and Kylie Jenner showing early appreciation for his poetry. Frith Hilton has since dedicated several poetry books to both Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner. Throughout this time, he collaborated closely with Chantel Jeffries and Sommer Ray, working on music demos with online producers before launching his website in 2023. In January 2024, having become associated with the Hilton family, he released a second edition of his poetry collection under a new title, Frith Hilton Collection I. By then, he had published over ten books and recorded over eight musical tapes. Howard Frith Hilton is a published poet under Frith Nightswan Publishers and a multifaceted artist known for his poetic writings, songwriting, and music.",

              <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Early Life and Roots</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">Howard Frith Hilton, a Sagittarius of the 17th, grew up surrounded by the quiet echoes of a now-dwindling atmosphere, the rustic air of solitude he often mentions missing in his writings. Reimagining his life's journey, inspired by the Hiltons, he formally legalized his full name, Howard Frith Hilton, to be represented by the initials H.F.H.</p>
              <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Academic and Professional Foundations</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">Frith holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which laid the foundation for his brief tenure as a web developer for various enterprises, ultimately becoming the bedrock of his career.</p>
              <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Breakthrough in Music</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">When asked about his first significant recognition, Frith responded simply, “<i>Moonlight. It was XXXtentacion’s moon.</i>” He then added with a broad smile, “<i>That shined a light on me; I was on the map.</i>”</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                This moment came in 2018, a few weeks after the original record’s release. Frith, then a web developer for a local startup, was preparing to start a band with an associate. They had begun planning a debut tape, but his partner’s absence from XXXtentacion’s Moonlight cover led to the project becoming a solo effort. Building from his recent success, the H.I.V. (Heartbreak In View) music tape was born. Released in September 2019 on SoundCloud under the moniker “TheoPhil,” with a bio that read, “Phil 4 U,” Frith’s debut music tape garnered attention. He promised fans a new body of work titled Sad Boi Tap3, but it was never released.</p>
              <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Evolution as a Poet</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">In 2019, after enjoying quiet success with significant plays on SoundCloud, Frith Hilton left his day job to focus on his art, and he continued to release songs, including <i>Sunday Special</i> from <i>H.I.V</i>, but little was publicized after the music video for <i>Bleeding Heart</i>. His presence dimmed as he quietly withdrew from his page. Known for his activity on Facebook, he shifted to Twitter (now X), where he had fewer followers. At the time, he declared himself Kelsey Karter’s biggest fan — whom he'd met after her infamous Harry Styles face tattoo clickbait record — reading all comments to her posts without contributing much himself. When questioned, he explained, “<i>I was curious about astrology. I didn’t understand how it’s a science</i>.”</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                It was not until 2020, after rediscovering Jessica Andrea, his favorite rapper’s ex-wife, that his poetic fervor became evident. Her presence in his social sphere gave him a voice, particularly within the warm community of the rapper’s fans, RATTPACK. His comments began to pour in, followed by emails. “<i>I sent her the first email on September 14, 2020; the timestamp reads 11:57 PM, and I simply said, ‘Hi, I hope you get this. I really need to know if you get this.’</i>” He wrote poetry for her frequently on X, introducing himself with five haiku poems before sharing other prosodic rants and poetic posts. A search for “<i>itsjessandrea</i>” at the time yielded more results from his tweets — mostly poems — than from any other account. Jessica Andrea had just returned to making music following her divorce, and Frith Hilton’s role was that of a muse, portraying a new cyber boyfriend. Though playing a student might have been more fitting. He dedicated his second poetry collection to Taylor Swift, acknowledging her as his teacher in a poem titled “Teacher.”</p>
              <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Literary Achievements and Notable Connections</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">The two continued their connection and spent their first Christmas holiday together. Through Jessica, Frith met Melanie Joy Fontana, whose praise for his poetry meant the world to him. Melanie, a renowned songwriter with credits for artists like Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, Britney Spears, and BTS, left a significant impact.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                Frith Hilton soon self-published his first poetry book, <i>Forest Collection</i>, under the pen name <i>Forest Theo Nightswan</i>, dedicating it to <i>Betty</i>, a character from Taylor Swift’s Folklore album. The poetry book, heavily influenced by Taylor Swift’s studio albums, used her themes and song titles up until the Evermore album to craft a narrative about his love for her, amidst his own turbulent grip on direction for his future as a poet and musical artist.</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                In private circles, Frith Hilton’s reputation as a burgeoning poet gained momentum with the release of his debut poetry book. Its first edition caught the attention of the Kardashian family, with Kendall Jenner expressing admiration for the poet and Kylie Jenner showing early appreciation for his poetry. Frith Hilton has since dedicated several poetry books to both Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner.</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">
                Throughout this time, he collaborated closely with Chantel Jeffries and Sommer Ray in, working on music demos with online producers before launching his <a href="https://www.frithhilton.com.ng" target="_blank">website</a> in 2023.</p>
              <p class="bringer-large-text" data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="150">Continued Growth and Legacy</p>
              <p data-appear="fade-up" data-delay="200">In January 2024, having become associated with the Hilton family, he released a second edition of his poetry collection under a new title, Frith Hilton Collection I. By then, he had published over ten books and recorded over eight musical tapes.</p>
